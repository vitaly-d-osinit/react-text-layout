# React coding task «Text Layout»

* We have a form with a text area where I can drop some long text and hit LAYOUT button.
* LAYOUT button navigates me to a 'Layout page'. 
* Text is not formatted anyhow - it remains just plain text regardless any tags in it.
* Layout page has 3 icon-buttons (take assets wherever you like): Single-column, 2 columns and 3 columns. Default is a single column.
* Layout buttons switch text view into corresponding number of columns (with nearly equal amount of text in each)
* In any view, texts with columns are editable. I can just put cursor to a middle of the second column for instance and write something.
* Edited text is saved, when switching view, I can see my modified text.

Application should be good-looking - apply some css, so that it doesn't look like a 2003 student's work
Use React.js/Typescript

Result should be provided as a code on Github   hosted version (Github pages would be fine, but if you have any other hosting - feel free to use it)
